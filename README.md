## ⚙️ Features  
- 🌱 **Image-based disease detection** using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**  
- 📊 **Training on labeled datasets** for accurate predictions  
- 📈 **Evaluation metrics** like accuracy, precision, recall  
- 🖥️ **Google Collab** implementation for easy experimentation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning   
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization   


## 📝 Results  
The model achieves **high accuracy** in detecting plant diseases, helping improve **precision agriculture** and reducing **crop losses**.
