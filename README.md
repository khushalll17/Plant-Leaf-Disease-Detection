# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect and classify plant leaf diseases using **deep learning**. The system processes images of plant leaves and identifies whether they are healthy or affected by diseases, helping farmers and researchers take timely action.

## ⚙️ Features  
- 🌱 **Image-based disease detection** using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**  
- 📊 **Training on labeled datasets** for accurate predictions  
- 📷 **Real-time disease classification** from leaf images  
- 📈 **Evaluation metrics** like accuracy, precision, recall  
- 🖥️ **Jupyter Notebook** implementation for easy experimentation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning  
- **OpenCV** for image processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development  


## 📝 Results  
The model achieves **high accuracy** in detecting plant diseases, helping improve **precision agriculture** and reducing **crop losses**.
